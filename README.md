   - Give a unique name for your RPi hostname.
   - Pick an appropriate username and password
   - Configure the WiFi to your hotspot (SIT WiFi doesnt work well with RPi)
   - Click on "Save"
   - Click on "Yes" and "Yes" again.

#### Section 2: Configuring Raspberry Pi
1. **Assembling Hardware**:
- Insert the MicroSD card into the Raspberry Pi 400.
- Power on the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Enabling VNC**:
- Connect to RPi 400 via SSH (e.g. use Putty).
- You can find the RPi400's IP via your mobile hotspot or router.
- Enable the VNC using the following command and selecting "Interfacing Options", navigate to "VNC", choose "Yes", select "Ok" and select "Finish".
  ```
  sudo raspi-config
  ```

3. **Setting Up a Static IP (Optional)**:
   - For easier connection, assign a static IP to your RPi 400.
   - Open Terminal and edit the `dhcpcd.conf` file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
     ```
   - Add the following lines at the end of the file (replace with your network details):
     ```
     interface eth0
     static ip_address=192.168.x.xxx/24
     static routers=192.168.x.x
     static domain_name_servers=192.168.x.x
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor (CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter).
   - Reboot the RPi 400.
4. **Installing VNC Viewer on Your Laptop**:
   - Download and install VNC Viewer on your laptop from the official [VNC Viewer website](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).
5. **Connecting to the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Open VNC Viewer on your laptop.
   - Enter the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (same IP address as used with SSH) and press Enter.
   - When prompted, enter the Raspberry Pi's username and password.
6. **Using Raspberry Pi Desktop Remotely**:
   - Once connected, you should see the Raspberry Pi's desktop interface on your laptop.
   - You can now use the Raspberry Pi as if you were working directly on it.
7. **Update the RPi 400 System**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - Update the system with the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

#### Section 3: Setting Up and Testing the Webcam
1. **Connecting the Webcam**:
   - Plug the webcam into a USB port on the RPi 400.
   - The drivers for the webcam
2. **Install Software to capture image**:
   - Ensure that you have internet access.
   - Install 'fswebcam' for capturing images:
     ```
     sudo apt install fswebcam
     ```
3. **Capture Image with Webcam**:
   - Use `fswebcam` to capture an image:
     ```
     fswebcam -r 1280x720 --no-banner image.jpg
     ```
4. **View and Edit Images (Optional)**:
   - Install an image editor like GIMP:
     ```
     sudo apt install gimp
     ```
   - Open the captured image in GIMP for editing.
5. **Recording Video**:
   - Install `ffmpeg` to record video from the webcam:
     ```
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```
   - Record a video from the webcam:
     ```
     ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 output.mp4
     ```
   - this command tells ffmpeg to capture video from the first connected webcam at a resolution of 640x480 pixels and a frame rate of 25 fps, and save it to a file named output.mp4. In addition, "-f" specifies the format to be used while "v4l2" stands for Video4Linux2, which is the standard video driver model for Linux for video capture.
6. **Play Video (Optional)**:
   - Install VLC media player:
     ```
     sudo apt install vlc
     ```
   - Play the recorded video using VLC:
     ```
     vlc output.mp4
     ```
7. **Checking for Audio Device**:
   - First, check if your system has recognized the webcam's microphone.
   - Open Terminal and type the following command to list all audio input devices:
     ```
     arecord -l
     ```
   - Look for your webcam in the list. It should be listed as a "USB Audio" with a specific device number.

8. **Testing the Microphone**:
   - To test if the microphone is working, record a short audio clip:
     ```
     arecord -D plughw:<CardNumber>,<DeviceNumber> -d 10 test.wav
     ```
   - Replace `<CardNumber>` and `<DeviceNumber>` with the numbers you found in the previous step. The `-d 10` flag tells `arecord` to record for 10 seconds.

9. **Playing the Recorded Audio**:
   - Play the recorded audio to check the quality:
     ```
     aplay test.wav
     ```
   - If you donâ€™t hear anything, adjust the microphone levels using the sound settings or `alsamixer` in the terminal.

#### Section 4: Advanced Applications (To Be Updated)

   - Introduction to using Python for controlling the webcam.
- **Creating a Surveillance System**:
   - Setting up motion detection using the webcam.
