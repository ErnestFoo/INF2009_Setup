**Using Raspberry Pi 4 for Edge Computing**

**Objective:** By the end of this session, participants will be able to set up their Raspberry Pi 4 for edge computing, understand its capabilities, and initiate an ML project.

---

**Prerequisites:**
1. Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspbian OS installed.
2. MicroSD card (16GB or more recommended).
3. Internet connectivity (Wi-Fi).
4. Basic knowledge of Python and Linux commands.
